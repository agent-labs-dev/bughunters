# Backend and native desktop patrols

Bugpatrol's web driver can test backend behavior exposed by a frontend: sending
a message, saving settings, switching tenants, or reopening persisted content.
For direct HTTP testing, use `app.platform: api` and the `request` tool. Keep
deterministic contract and background-worker tests alongside the patrol.

## Direct API patrols

```yaml
app:
  platform: api
  connect:
    url: http://127.0.0.1:8000
    headers:
      Authorization: 'Bearer ${SESSION_TOKEN}'
    # Read-only by default. Enable writes only against disposable data.
    methods: [GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE]
    timeoutMs: 30000
```

Use the usual setup captures to provision a session. `request` accepts a method,
relative URL, optional headers, and a string body (use `Content-Type` for JSON).
Credentials use placeholders and replay preserves them. For entities created
within a routine, pass `capture: {RESPONSE_THREAD_ID: "/result/id"}` to `request`,
then use `{{RESPONSE_THREAD_ID}}` in subsequent URLs/bodies. Each replay refreshes
those ids. Captures accept JSON pointers to strings/numbers, cannot overwrite
setup/auth variables, and cannot expose redacted credential fields. Requests cannot leave
the configured origin and redirects are not followed, so credentials cannot
follow a redirect to another server. Request/response bodies are bounded to
1 MiB and a larger response fails explicitly rather than silently truncating.

The returned status and sanitized body are HTTP evidence. Screenshots render
that transcript; they are not screenshots of a product UI. Remote HTML is
displayed as text. Captured secrets and credential fields in JSON responses
are redacted before rendering. A 401 or 403 can be correct behavior, not a bug.

`bugpatrol init --platform api --url http://127.0.0.1:8000` creates a starter.

## Run a disposable stack

Put Bugpatrol's config in the repository whose code you intend to investigate.
Use `app.setup` to prepare an isolated database and cache, migrate them, start
the backend and frontend, and create a disposable account. Point the frontend
at that backend explicitly; a local frontend using a production API is not an
isolated test.

Setup commands can capture dynamic URLs and a short-lived login session:

```yaml
app:
  platform: web
  source: .
  setup:
    - run: ./scripts/prepare-patrol-stack
      capture:
        WEB_URL: 'WEB_URL=(http://[^\s]+)'
    - run: ./scripts/start-patrol-api
      background: true
      readyWhen: 'API ready'
    - run: ./scripts/start-patrol-web
      background: true
      readyWhen: 'Web ready'
    - run: ./scripts/seed-patrol-user
      capture:
        SESSION_TOKEN: 'SESSION_TOKEN=([^\s]+)'
  connect:
    url: '${WEB_URL}'
  instructions: .bugpatrol/instructions.md
```

These commands are application-owned examples, not built-in commands. Supply
the rest of the configuration from `bugpatrol init`; see [configuration](configuration.md).
Describe your development-only session handoff in `instructions.md`, using
`{{SESSION_TOKEN}}` where needed. Never give the explorer backend service keys.
Captured variables are redacted from setup reporting, but browser state and
screenshots remain sensitive. Keep run artifacts private and ignored.

Start with the fixer and GitHub agent disabled and `agents.patrol.pull: false`
while investigating a feature checkout. Run a short `explore`, inspect its
coverage, then a longer `explore` and `judge`. A successful greeting is evidence
for that flow; it does not establish tenant isolation or worker reliability.

## Give the explorer observable consequences

Seed two tenants with distinguishable content. Ask the explorer to switch
between them, create content, reopen it, reload, cancel a running operation,
and verify settings persist. Define prohibited actions such as payments,
external messages, real integrations, and production device provisioning.

The web driver reports failed fetch/XHR/document requests and console errors.
Use those to investigate, then confirm the user-visible consequence and trace
the failure in backend logs. A cancelled stream during navigation alone is not
proof of broken persistence. Supply a separate backend trace or direct API
reproduction when the UI cannot distinguish the suspected failure.

Background setup processes stop when the session ends. Explicitly tear down
datastores and remove development identity-provider users using your own
lifecycle tooling; process shutdown does not delete those resources.

## Visible native sessions

Use `app.platform: desktop` on Linux to launch an app in its own Xvfb display,
DBus session, HOME and XDG directories. This isolates keyboard focus from the
user's desktop; it is not a filesystem or network sandbox. App setup remains
on the host; only disposable app credentials should reach the launched app.
The driver uses the installed Cua binary through a run-owned `mcp --direct`
transport and never connects to or stops a shared daemon.

```yaml
app:
  platform: desktop
  connect:
    cua:
      command: cua-driver          # or the installed cua-jev prototype path
      windowManager: openbox
      launch: /absolute/path/to/app
      args: ['--user-data-dir={{PRIVATE_DIR}}/profile']
      windowTitle: My App          # required if several initial windows match
      deliveryMode: foreground    # explicit; defaults to background
      viewer:
        enabled: true
        port: 0                   # loopback only; choose an available port
        allowTakeover: false
```

Prerequisites: Linux, `setsid`, `xvfb-run`, `xauth`, `dbus-run-session`, Openbox,
AT-SPI bus launcher/registry, and Cua with window capture and input tools.
Chromium additionally needs `--force-renderer-accessibility`. Cua refuses
Chromium's X11 background input; explicitly select foreground delivery inside
the private display. There is no automatic fallback to the shared desktop.
Apps must support a separate instance/profile. `{{PRIVATE_DIR}}` expands only
in trusted launch arguments and is removed on close.

The viewer serves authenticated captures on loopback, with input disabled by
default. Its capability URL is saved privately in
`.bugpatrol/runs/desktop-viewer.json`; the terminal prints only its tokenless
address. Do not share the capability or screenshots. The browser displays
images of the app rather than a window that can receive host input.

Opting into `allowTakeover: true` adds a Take over button. Takeover waits for
in-flight input, pauses agent operations, and admits user input only while the
human owns control. Both ownership changes and human actions are traced;
typed user text is not logged. Returning to the agent invalidates stale refs
and starts a new replay trail. A pending action fails until the agent looks
again. Captures from the viewer never replace the agent's observation, and
semantic targets are refreshed before delivery to avoid stale Cua tokens.
Missing or ambiguous semantic targets fail; there is no silent point fallback.
For controls without accessibility, `tap_point` takes an explicit point in the
latest screenshot and records degraded replay. A resized window requires a
fresh observation before any point action.

Shutdown stops the viewer, closes the run's MCP transport, kills its private
process group, and removes temporary profiles. It never calls `cua-driver stop`.

Run real native qualification after installation:

```sh
BUGPATROL_CUA_E2E=1 BUGPATROL_CUA_COMMAND=/path/to/cua-driver \
  pnpm exec vitest run packages/drivers/src/cua
```

Normal CI covers the viewer/ownership boundaries without native prerequisites;
the real native test is explicitly skipped unless that flag is set.

Response captures hold non-secret identifiers, including numeric IDs. Use explicit
`{{RESPONSE_NAME}}` placeholders in subsequent routine steps; literal values are
never inferred as IDs. Configured/setup credentials and their historical values
remain redacted. Captures parse credential-sanitized JSON before evidence redaction.
